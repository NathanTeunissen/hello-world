Pseudo code:
-Create dictionary to reference pairs of logins/passwords
-Prompt user to input a login and a password
-If users login/password input matches that from the dictionary pair, print a login successful message
-If users login/password input does not match that from the dictionary pairs, print a try again message
-If user fails 5 times, break their mental with a disheartening message
